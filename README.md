		<p>just like fgets function in the C library function
		<center>char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream)</center>
		When fgets is called, it reads characters from the file stream stream and stores them in the buffer pointed to by str. The function reads characters until it encounters a newline character ('\n') or the end of the file, or until n-1 characters have been read, whichever comes first. The newline character, if any, is also stored in the buffer.</p>
